# Random search with multiple targets model

An application for modeling the process of random search by several targets in a cellular structure with the possibility of conducting experiments based on the choice of a probabilistic distribution of transitions.

The application was created for the Physics Department of Moscow State University to be used in tests for students in order to conduct experiments and their subsequent analysis.

Full information about theoretical basis of random search may be found [here](./source/statphys_theory.pdf) (rus).
